This is a mathematical puzzle game. Two magic double squares (https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carr√©_magique_(math)) with a pre-determined size are given at the start, one with numbers / fractions in disorder and the other with the missing numbers / fractions. The goal of the game is therefore to use the left double-square to fill the right one.
